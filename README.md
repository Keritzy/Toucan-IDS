# Toucan

Toucan is currently a monitor to defend against man in the middle attacks (Both IPv4/IPv6 attacks) on a network. For IPv4, when an attacker is discovered sending gratuitous ARPs, or gratuitous neighbor advertisements (since ICMPv6 replaced ARP for IPv6 networks), Toucan will alert the admin.


*I have included an example log file also in which I ran the program on a /24 network and did an arp-scan just to generate some activity
